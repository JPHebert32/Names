# Project_2_Names
We want to gather data for names and popularity throughout the US. 
Using Social Security data, namefinders, and Freakonomics sources.
We have two files from Social Security: Names by State and Names by Year. These are hundreds of separate text files, so we are combining all of this info and appending it to a single dataframe. We are creating and transforming the data in Jupyter Notebook. The html and python files will be worked on in VS Code. We will need to use postgresql as well. 
Visualizations will include some sort of map to show stats over the states and some different graphing techniques to show different trends that we find interesting. 
We will use the maps functions we have been working with python and D3. We are hoping to create an interactive map where hovering over a state will pop-up the most popular girl and boy names. We will use a Word Cloud from D3.
