# Project_2_Names
We want to gather data for names and popularity throughout the US. 
Using Social Security data for names nationaly as main data source.
We have two files from Social Security: Names by State and Names by Year. These are hundreds of separate text files. We are creating dataframes and transforming the data in Jupyter Notebook. The html and python files worked on in VS Code. Postgresql, pgadmin, and MySQL were used for the database and subsequent tables organized there. 
Visualizations include dynamic line chart to show the changes in the popularity of a name over time.
There is a search bar at the top which changes the line graph as well as changes the display in the dynamic table on the right. That table will show all data from 2000-2018 for all males with a count specified in the app.py. Once a name is typed in at the top, the table displays the info for that name over the allotted time frame. 
Includes a Word Cloud from ZingChart and a bar chart from HighChart, which display the top 100 names from the most recent year - 2018. Both charts show the count for that name when you hover over the icon for each name.
